# BinaryTreeAnalysis


Python script to perform basic binary tree analysis. 

I used this script wayyyy back in the day when I was learing about Buffer Overflows.  There are currently far better tools out on 
the market.  However, this is a simple tool and there is something charming in the simple, right? To use, attach your vulnerable
program (say a FTP server) to your debugger, change the apporporate veriables in the BinTreeAn.py file (for example username, 
password, buffer size, etc).  Execute file and watch in the debugger where it crashes. HINT: You should be looking for a huge pile
of "A"s.
